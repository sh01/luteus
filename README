== Meta ==
This is the README file for luteus.

== Purpose ==
Luteus is an IRC bouncer, written with an eye towards features, flexibility,
and extensibility.

== Dependencies ==
* a posix-like OS
* Python 3.x
* Gonium >= 0.6

== Licensing ==
All of luteus is licensed under the GNU GPL version 2 or later (your choice);
see COPYING for the full license text.

== Getting started ==
The following instructions assume you have a python 3.x interpreter called
'python3' in your path; if you don't, adjust them accordingly.

Copy the provided ./examples/luteus.conf to ~/.luteus/luteus.conf, and edit
it to your needs. Run luteus using 'python3 ./tools/luteus --debug', and see
if it throws any errors.
If not, connect to the address and port of one of the pseudoservers you
configured, and authenticate to luteus with
'PASS <network name>:<user name>:<password>'.

Once connected, you can interrogate and control luteus over IRC; use
   '/MSG luteus.bnc HELP'
(replace 'luteus.bnc' with the server name you set for luteus if you
 changed it from the default) to get an overview about the available
commands.

To make luteus fork into the background, simply run it without --debug. To
install it locally, use the provided setup.py file;
'python3 ./setup.py install --help' should get you started.
